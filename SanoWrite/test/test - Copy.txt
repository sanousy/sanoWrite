Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thoughtit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to havewondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started toher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had neverbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch totake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across thefield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it popdown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.;;hello;;bold;;;;www.gmail.com ;;;;gmail; www.gmail.com;;@;;;;the main menu;;&link1;;;;click here ;;@link1;;//TABLE//ROWThere was nothing so VERY remarkable //CELLThere was nothing so VERY remarkable //ROWThere was nothing so VERY remarkable //CELLThere was nothing so VERY remarkable \\  ;  * hi I am happy *	 hi I am happy*		 hi Iam happy*			 hi I am happy; ?;normal "helvitica" 13  |    || .. |     | <<  ??normal=>title  17 >< ??normal=>level1 14 << PG TOC [b][i][u][x] #red #ff0000 #/ffffff #/white num[n.] |     ||..|     | ==1.2 =^2 =_2 %#RED %1 %ALL %[+] %top %bottom %middle %right %left %center %TBMRLC %^ %_ %- %|.. %= %||| %|.|
